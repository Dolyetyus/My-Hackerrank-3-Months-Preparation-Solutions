# [center][size=5][b]My Hackerrank 3 Months Preparation Kit Solutions[/b][/size][/center]
Here I share my solutions for Hackerrank's 3 Month's Preparation Kit, the questions are designed to prepare you for the future interviews. I'm planning to solve all the problems in C++ first, and then in Python and maybe in Java later.</br>
